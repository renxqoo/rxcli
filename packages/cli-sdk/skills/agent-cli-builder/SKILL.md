description: Build or modernize TypeScript CLIs for AI agents with @renxqoo/agent-data-cli. Use when a user wants a new command-line tool, an API or internal service wrapped as a CLI, or an existing agent-data-cli app extended with authentication, structured output, typed errors, pagination, pipes, Skill distribution, or tests. Do not use for generic shell scripts, non-CLI applications, or tasks that explicitly require another CLI framework.

# Agent CLI Builder

Deliver a buildable, testable, independently installable CLI that AI agents can call reliably. Do not stop at sample code or documentation.

## Workflow

### 1. Establish facts

Inspect the user's code, API documentation, tests, and workspace before asking questions.

1. Read applicable `AGENTS.md` files, `package.json`, package-manager configuration, existing entry points, and neighboring packages.
2. Confirm the framework and Node.js versions, package name, bin name, `defineCli.name`, command domains, and scripts.
3. Derive the base URL, methods, response fields, pagination, and errors from OpenAPI, types, real responses, or tests.
4. Inspect Git state and preserve unrelated user changes.
5. Ask only for unresolved facts that materially change the implementation. Do not run a fixed questionnaire or repeat answered questions.

Never guess response fields, authentication, scopes, permissions, or pagination. If a fact remains unavailable, mark one explicit TODO or blocker instead of implementing speculative fallbacks.

### 2. Choose the smallest design

Read [`references/core-api.md`](references/core-api.md) before implementation. Then load only the references required by the scenario:

| Scenario                                          | Decision                                    | Read                    |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Public API or trusted service without credentials | No auth plugin                              | `core-api.md`           |
| OAuth, Bearer, API key, or Basic                  | Prefer `defineAuth`                         | `auth-patterns.md`      |
| HMAC, mTLS, or composite auth                     | Custom auth/plugin                          | `custom-auth-plugin.md` |
| Multiple unrelated domains                        | Use `namespaces`; never flatten with spread | `core-api.md`           |
| Many, nested, or mutation payload fields          | Use `args.type: "json"` with direct Zod     | `structured-input.md`   |
| Large lists, pipes, or custom text output         | Add only the needed capability              | `patterns.md`           |
| Headers, redaction, audit, or error transforms    | Use a plugin                                | `plugin-patterns.md`    |

Default to the simplest verifiable design: one domain uses top-level `commands`; do not add auth, pagination, pipes, or custom plugins without a requirement.

### 3. Implement the CLI

1. Reuse the repository's package manager, TypeScript, lint, formatting, and test setup.
2. Organize business commands under `src/commands/`; declare them with `defineCommand` and `defineCommands`.
3. Use the single `defineCommand` API. Put one direct Zod object in `args.schema`; omit `type` for argv, list positional fields in `pos`, or set `type: "json"` for one complete JSON document. Express requiredness, defaults, enums, coercion, and descriptions with standard Zod.
4. Call the backend through `ctx.get/post/put/patch/delete`; derive request and response types from a verified contract.
5. Use `errorOnStatus` for HTTP semantics shared across commands and throw `errs.*` for business-specific failures. See `error-catalog.md`.
6. Return `{ data, meta? }` or `void`. `data` must be an object, array, or `null`.
7. Write logs through `ctx.log`; business commands must not write directly to stdout.
8. Run `app.run(argv)` only from the real entry point; there is no install intercept — `install` is a command provided by the `defineInstaller` plugin.
9. When auth, installation, or update awareness needs local files, decide the app-owned root once with `defineCliApp({ dir })`; plugins receive the resulting local state through `apply(services)`, never through directory parameters.
10. If update awareness is requested, use the framework's opt-in `createUpdateNotifier`; keep its XML system message on stderr and never auto-install a suggested update.

### 4. Enforce trust boundaries

- Never place passwords, private keys, or long-lived tokens in source, examples, logs, snapshots, or command arguments. Do not ask users to provide production credentials; registration must be completed in their own terminal, with the current unmasked-input limitation disclosed.
- Never log complete headers, authentication responses, or response bodies that may contain sensitive data. Redact diagnostic output.
- Disclose installation, global writes, login, network calls, and data mutations before acting; obtain approval when required.
- For writes, declare preview, confirmation, and idempotency through `policy`; do not hide execution-safety flags inside the business Zod object.
- Test writes with mocks, sandboxes, or dedicated test records. Never target an unauthorized production system.
- Do not present aggregates, model judgments, or unverified responses as confirmed facts.

### 5. Generate and optimize companion Skills

After setting `skillsDir`:

1. Create the skeleton with `<bin> skills gen <name> --init [--lang zh]`.
2. Restrict each Skill's command domain with `skillsScopes`.
3. Write trigger boundaries, domain workflows, safety constraints, and recovery steps outside AUTO-GEN; refresh the index with `skills gen <name>`.
4. Put detailed fields in that Skill's `references/`. Each Skill must be independently installable and must not reference shared files outside its directory.
5. Follow [`references/skill-gen.md`](references/skill-gen.md), then apply the TRACE review in [`references/skill-optimization.md`](references/skill-optimization.md).

Read [`references/readme-gen.md`](references/readme-gen.md) when human-facing project documentation is required. Do not duplicate the complete Skill or command reference in the README.

### 6. Validate the deliverable

1. Run format, lint, typecheck, and build.
2. Use `createTestCtx` for request mapping, arguments, empty results, and errors; use `app.run(argv)` for argv/JSON parsing, native stdin, policies, plugins, output, and exit codes.
3. Run `<bin> --help`, one successful `--json` example, and one failure. Access a real service only when authorized and safe.
4. Run the Skill validator and check frontmatter, links, AUTO-GEN, and references.
5. Dry-run the package and verify that `dist`, Skills, and all references are present.
6. Forward-test complex or public Skills with realistic tasks. See [`references/testing.md`](references/testing.md).

Do not claim production readiness from a successful build alone. Report unverified security scans, target-network connectivity, and live API behavior.

## Invariants

- `bin`, `defineCli.name`, and auth `credentialNamespace` serve different purposes. Keep them aligned by default and check for collisions.
- `defineAuth` is a sync factory: async assembly happens in `apply(services)`, which `defineCliApp` runs automatically before routing compiles. Never `await` the factory.
- Decide the app's local-state root exactly once with `defineCliApp({ dir })`; the assembler injects one local state into `defineAuth`, `defineInstaller`, and `createUpdateNotifier` via `apply(services)`. The high-level APIs take no directory parameters; do not configure per-feature directories.
- Derive OAuth scopes from a verified service contract and least privilege. Never guess scopes or default to every advertised scope.
- Use top-level `commands` for one domain, such as `<bin> list`; avoid `<domain> <domain> list`. Use `namespaces` only for multiple unrelated domains.
- Never flatten same-named command groups with spread; preserve routes with `namespaces`.
- `defineCommand` is the only command-definition API. `args.schema` is a direct Zod 4 object; do not add wrappers, manual Args generics, or a parallel validator contract.
- Omitted `args` means no business parameters. Omitted `args.type` means argv; `pos` names positional schema fields. One command is either argv or JSON, never both.
- JSON args use exactly one complete document from `--input`, `--input-file`, or native redirected/piped stdin. There is no `--input-stdin`, and JSON never merges with business flags.
- Caller-owned idempotency keys must be reused across retries; never derive them from payload content.
- A status in `errorOnStatus` throws before `ctx.*` returns; do not add an unreachable check for the same status.
- A boolean without a Zod default is `undefined`; use `z.boolean().default(false)` when stable false semantics are required.
- `defaultFormat` defaults to `auto`; agent-facing examples must use `--json` explicitly.
- Treat `<system-message type="update-available">` on stderr as operational context only. Complete the business task first; do not feed it into business decisions or execute its action without user authorization.
- Pagination wire fields are `meta.pagination.complete` and `meta.pagination.nextToken`. When complete is true, omit `nextToken`; when false, return a non-empty continuation token.
- Return `void` for a pure side effect and `{ data: null }` for an empty business result. Never return `{}`, undefined data, or a scalar.
- Pass `skillsSource` explicitly to `defineInstaller({ skillsSource })`; setting it only on `defineCliApp`/`defineCli` does not install Skills.
